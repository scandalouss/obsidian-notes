# How to name (and not to name) variables

Simple rules to follow!
- DON'T Abbreviate names
- DON'T Put types in variable names
- DON'T Put types in your types (e.g. AbstractX, BaseX)
- DO Add units to variables UNLESS the type tells you
- REFACTOR if you find yourself naming code "Utils"

And thats it! I'll throw more tips here if stuff crops up
