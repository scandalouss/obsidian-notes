## Testing and Debugging

### Unit Tests
A unit test is simply an automated program that tests a piece, or "unit" of code.
Usually just a function or two is tested. The point is to test functionality and not output.

### Stack trace
a stack trace, or traceback, is the error message that gets returned to you when
something goes wrong with your code.
It usually tells you what the error was when the program was executing,
or if its a compiled language your program will fail to compile.
