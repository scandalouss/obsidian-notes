# chapter7 - Comparisons


## Comparison Operators

sometimes it's necessary to compare two values, we call this ``Boolean logic``

    < - "Less than"
    > - "Greater than"
    <= - "Less than or equal to"
    >= - "Greater than or equal to"
    == - "Equal to",
    != - "Not equal to

the result of a comparison is just a boolean, either ``True`` or ``False``
