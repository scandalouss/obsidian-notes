## Variables

Variables allow you to store data for your program.
You can assign as many variables as you want
Depending on the programming language, you will need to specify the type for the variable.
This doesn't matter so much in Python, where a variables type can change on the fly.
But in a language like C or C++, you must specify the type when declaring the variable,
and you must make sure the data stored in the variable matches the type.
Python is considered "dynamically typed", C/C++ is "statically typed"

### Variable types

Strings - Store text
Integers - Store whole numbers
Floats - Store decimals
Boolean - Stores a true/false value (can also be swapped with 0/1 integer)



## Comments
Comments are lines that you can write that are ignored by the interpreter/compiler.
They allow you to write notes for yourself or others in the code itself.
They should try to be used sparingly, as its said good code is
"Self explanatory"
Whatever that means

Just don't write dumbass comments, and try to be concise
Don't explain what it is the code is doing, but WHY its doing it.
Unless the code really needs explanation on what its doing

## NoneType

NoneType is a special variable within Python to define an empty, or "null" value.
In other languages, this might be called "void" to define nothing, or just "null"
